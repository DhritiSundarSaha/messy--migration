In accordance with the submission guidelines, I have pushed the complete refactored codebase to a new Git repository. The central documentation for this project is the **`CHANGES.md`** file, which details:
* Major issues identified in the original code.
* A full breakdown of the changes I made and the reasoning behind them.
* The assumptions and trade-offs considered during the process.
* Potential improvements that could be made with additional time.

You can access the repository with all the necessary files here:
https://github.com/DhritiSundarSaha/messy--migration

I trust this meets all the requirements outlined in the assignment. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Dhriti Sundar Saha
